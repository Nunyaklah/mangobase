# Introduction

::: warning
Mango is still under heavy development; it's not advisable to use this for a production app as the API/design may change rapidly. You can however try it on side projects and proof-of-concepts.

Mango (short for Mangobase) is a Javascript low-code backend framework for building [RESTful](rest.md) applications. Given that REST apps follow a convention on how to treat data, Mango provides the following benefits:

- Reduces boilerplate for creating services for data models
- Performs schema validation
- Handles errors
- Provides convenient querying mechanisms

When building REST backends, it's ubiquitous that you implement all of these features and some. Mango takes care of all of those.

::: tip
Being a low-code framework, you get to write code too, though a lot of things have been taken care of for you.
