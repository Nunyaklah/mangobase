# Database adapters

Mangobase is designed to be database agnostic. This means you can implement any [Database](/api/base/Database) for your app. However, there's an official support for just Mongo at the moment.

You're welcome to author a database adapter for your favorite database and share with the community. [Here](https://github.com/blackmann/mangobase/blob/master/mongo-db/src/mongodb.ts) is an implementation of the MongoDb adapter.
