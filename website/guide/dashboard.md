# Dashboard

The dashboard is central to how you use Mangobase. It offers a very intuitive experience.

## Collections

This page is where you see all your collections, add new ones or edit existing ones. Selecting a collection allows you to see all the data that has been created (in a paginated format).

It also provides a filter/query input to help you search for specific data.

The query filter, at the moment, is a work-in-progress

### Hooks editor

The hooks editor allows you to compose before and after hooks for your collection's service. It is a very intuitive and creative way to extend the functionality of your service.

You can select from a number of pre-installed plugin hooks or [write your own](/guide/hooks#registering-a-plugin-hook).

See [hooks](/guide/hooks) for more information. Below is a video demonstrating how to use the hooks editor.

## Logs

There is a page to show request logs. When a request is not _ok_, the error data is logged and you can see it here.

## Settings

The settings page allows you to configure your app. At the moment, it only shows the developers added to the project and your profile.
